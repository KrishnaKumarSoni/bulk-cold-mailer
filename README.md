## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Tool

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First things first, let's get the code on your machine. Open your terminal and run:

### Step 3: Set Up Google Cloud Credentials

We need to set up Google Cloud credentials to use the Google Sheets API. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Create a Project in Google Cloud**:
   - Head over to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Click on the project drop-down at the top and select "New Project".
   - Name your project something fun and click "Create".

2. **Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to `APIs & Services` > `Library`.
   - Search for "Google Sheets API" and click on it, then click "Enable".
   - Search for "Google Drive API" and click on it, then click "Enable".

3. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.
   - Click on "Create Credentials" and select "Service Account".
   - Fill in the service account details and click "Create".
   - On the next screen, click "Create Key" and select "JSON". This will download your credentials file.

4. **Set Up OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Go to `APIs & Services` > `OAuth consent screen`.
   - Choose "External" for User Type and click "Create".

5. **Assign Roles to the Service Account**:
   - Go back to `APIs & Services` > `Credentials`.
   - Click on the service account you created.
   - Under the "Permissions" tab, click "Add Member".
   - Add the email address of your service account (found in your `credentials.json` under `client_email`).
   - Assign the roles `Editor` and `Viewer`.

6. **Save the Credentials File**:
   - Rename the downloaded JSON file to `credentials.json`.
   - Place the `credentials.json` file in the root directory of this project.

### Step 4: Prepare Your Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet with the following columns:

- `company_name`
- `company_domain`
- `full_name`
- `headline`
- `about`
- `company_about`

Share the sheet with the email address of your service account (found in your `credentials.json` under `client_email`).
